## 1. Header Files and Global Constants

- **Header File Inclusions**
  - `#include <easyx.h>`: This includes the EasyX graphics library for drawing graphics.
  - `#include <stdio.h>`: Standard input/output library.
  - `#include <math.h>`: Provides mathematical functions (such as sin, cos, pow, sqrt).
  - `#include <stdlib.h>`: Provides functions for random number generation (like rand and srand).
  - `#include <time.h>`: Provides time functions to seed the random number generator.
- **Global Constants**
  - `const int xScreen = 1200;` and `const int yScreen = 800;` define the window width and height, respectively.
  - Mathematical constants:
    - `PI` is used for angle calculations.
    - `e` is used in exponential calculations (for computing probabilities later).
  - `averag_distance` sets the minimum distance between small circles to avoid overlapping too closely.
  - `quantity` defines the number of particles (or original points) to be generated.
  - `circles` defines the number of small circles (used later for expanding to more particles).
  - `frames` defines the number of animation frames rendered to images (ensuring a high enough frame rate for smooth animation).

## 2. Data Structure and Color Array

- **Structure `Ponit`**
   This structure includes three members:
  - `double x, y;` – representing the 2D coordinates.
  - `COLORREF color;` – used to store the color, set by the RGB macro in EasyX.
- **Color Array `colors`**
   This array holds 7 different colors (in RGB format) with comments describing each color's effect (for example, "ultra-light pink" for highlights, "cherry blossom pink," etc.).
  - These colors are later used when drawing the particles—either chosen randomly or under certain conditions.

------

## 3. Coordinate Conversion Functions

- **screen_x(double x)**
   Converts the mathematical x-coordinate to the screen coordinate by shifting the origin horizontally to the center:

  ```c
  x += xScreen / 2;
  return x;
  ```

- **screen_y(double y)**
   Converts the mathematical y-coordinate to the screen coordinate by inverting the y-axis (since in the mathematical coordinate system the y-axis goes up, but in screen coordinates, it goes down) and shifting the origin vertically to the center:

  ```c
  y = yScreen / 2 - y;
  return y;
  ```

------

## 4. Random Number Generator Function

- createRandom(int x1, int x2)
  - Generates a random integer within the range `[x1, x2]`.
  - If `x2` is greater than `x1`, it returns `rand() % (x2 - x1 + 1) + x1`; otherwise, it simply returns `x1`.
  - This encapsulation ensures safe random number generation even if the parameters are equal.

------

## 5. Particle Data Generation and Animation Frame Pre-rendering – `create_date()` Function

This function is divided into two main stages:

### 5.1 Generating the Original Heart Curve Points (`origin_ponits`)

- **Curve Formula**
   The code uses a parametric equation to draw the heart shape:

  ```c
  x2 = 16 * pow(sin(radin), 3);
  y2 = 13 * cos(radin) - 5 * cos(2 * radin) - 2 * cos(3 * radin) - cos(4 * radin) + 0.5;
  ```

  This is the famous heart curve formula, using a combination of trigonometric functions to generate the heart outline.

- **Controlling the Spacing Between Points**

  - The distance between the current point `(x2, y2)` and the previous point `(x1, y1)` is calculated using: distance=(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2\text{distance} = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}
  - Only if `distance > averag_distance` is the point saved to prevent overcrowding.

- **Setting the Color**

  - If `index < quantity / 3`, the color is set to `colors[0]` (the ultra-light pink, used for highlights).
  - Otherwise, a random color from `colors[1]` to `colors[6]` is chosen.

- **Storing the Point**

  - The calculated point `(x2, y2)` is stored in the `origin_ponits` array, and the previous point is updated to the current one.

### 5.2 Expanding from Original Points to Generate Numerous Particles (`ponits`)

- **Loop Over `size`**

  - The loop variable `size` runs from `0.1` to `10` in steps of `0.08`, controlling the scaling of the heart curve. This produces a layered effect where the heart expands outward.

- **Probability Control**

  - A probability value 

    ```
    p
    ```

     is computed as:

    ```c
    p = 1 / (1 + pow(e, 8 - size / 2));
    ```

    As 

    ```
    size
    ```

     increases, the probability changes, controlling the density of particles.

- **Inner Loop Over Original Points**

  - For each original point, the code checks if a new particle should be generated based on the probability:

    ```c
    if (p > createRandom(0, 100) / 100.0)
    ```

  - If the condition is met, a new particle is created by scaling the original point by `size` and adding a slight random adjustment (`createRandom(-4,4)`), which makes the particle distribution appear more natural.

  - The particle's color is randomly chosen from the available colors.

- **Recording Total Number of Particles**

  - The variable `index` is used to record the total number of particles generated and is later saved into `ponits_size` for use in rendering each frame.

### 5.3 Pre-rendering Animation Frames

- **Loop Over Frames**

  - The code creates each frame in a loop:

    ```c
    for (int f = 0; f < frames; ++f)
    ```

  - For each frame, an `IMAGE` object is created with dimensions `xScreen` by `yScreen`, and `SetWorkingImage(&images[f])` is called to set the drawing target to this image instead of the screen.

- **Updating Particle Positions**

  - For each particle, the current position 

    ```
    (x, y)
    ```

     is updated based on:

    - Calculating the distance from the origin:

      ```c
      double dis = sqrt(pow(x, 2) + pow(y, 2));
      ```

    - Computing a “push” factor using:

      ```c
      double dis_in = 5 - 0.00009 * dis * dis + 0.35714 * dis;
      ```

    - Determining the displacement in the x and y directions:

      ```c
      double x_dis = dis_in * x / dis / frames;
      double y_dis = dis_in * y / dis / frames;
      ```

    - Adding a small random disturbance (`(rand() % 5 - 2) / 100.0`) to both x and y for irregular motion.

    - Updating the particle position with these calculated displacements.

- **Drawing the Particle**

  - After updating, the code sets the fill color using 

    ```
    setfillcolor(ponits[index].color)
    ```

     and draws a solid circle (with radius 1) at the transformed screen coordinates:

    ```c
    solidcircle(screen_x(ponits[index].x), screen_y(ponits[index].y), 1);
    ```

This process pre-renders 20 frames of the heart-particle animation, which will be played in the main loop.

------

## 6. Main Function (`main()`)

- **Initialization**

  - `srand(time(NULL));` seeds the random number generator with the current time to ensure different random effects on each run.
  - `initgraph(xScreen, yScreen);` creates a graphics window of size 1200×800 using EasyX.
  - `BeginBatchDraw();` enables double-buffered drawing to reduce flickering and ensure smooth animation.

- **Calling the Pre-rendering Function**

  - The function `create_date();` is called to generate the pre-rendered animation frames and particle data.

- **Switching Drawing Target**

  - `SetWorkingImage();` resets the drawing target to the screen (the default drawing surface).

- **Animation Control Variables**

  - `int f = 0;` tracks the current frame index.
  - Boolean variables `extend` and `shrink` are used to control the forward and reverse playback of the frame sequence, creating a back-and-forth animation loop.

- **Main Animation Loop**

  - Fading (Residual) Effect

    :

    - At the start of each loop iteration, a semi-transparent black rectangle is drawn over the entire window using:

      ```c
      setfillcolor(0x10000000);  // ARGB format: low transparency black
      solidrectangle(0, 0, xScreen, yScreen);
      ```

      This creates a fading trail effect as the previous frame gradually disappears.

  - Drawing the Current Frame

    :

    - The current pre-rendered image is drawn onto the screen with:

      ```c
      putimage(0, 0, &images[f]);
      ```

    - `FlushBatchDraw();` refreshes the double-buffered drawing so that the new frame appears on the screen.

  - Updating the Frame Index

    :

    - If `extend` is true, the frame index `f` increases until it reaches the last frame (`f == 19`), at which point `shrink` is set to true and the animation reverses.
    - If in reverse mode (`extend` is false), the frame index decreases until it reaches the first frame (`f == 0`), then it switches back to forward mode.
    - `Sleep(30);` or `Sleep(20);` is called to control the animation speed.

------

## 7. EasyX Function Calls

Below are explanations for key EasyX functions used:

- **initgraph(width, height)**
  - Creates a drawing window with the specified width and height. For example, `initgraph(xScreen, yScreen);` creates a window of size 1200×800.
- **BeginBatchDraw() and FlushBatchDraw()**
  - `BeginBatchDraw()` starts the double-buffered drawing mode, so that drawing is done off-screen.
  - `FlushBatchDraw()` pushes the off-screen buffer to the display, reducing flicker and ensuring smooth animation.
- **SetWorkingImage() / SetWorkingImage(&image)**
  - `SetWorkingImage(&images[f])` sets the drawing target to a memory image (one of the pre-rendered frames).
  - Calling `SetWorkingImage()` with no arguments resets the target back to the default screen.
- **setfillcolor(color)**
  - Sets the current fill color for drawing. Subsequent drawing functions (like `solidcircle` or `solidrectangle`) will use this color.
- **solidcircle(x, y, radius)**
  - Draws a solid circle at the specified `(x, y)` location with the given radius.
  - The coordinates are transformed using `screen_x` and `screen_y` to map mathematical coordinates to screen positions.
- **solidrectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2)**
  - Draws a filled rectangle with the top-left corner at `(x1, y1)` and the bottom-right corner at `(x2, y2)`.
  - In the animation loop, it is used to create a fading overlay effect.
- **putimage(x, y, &image)**
  - Draws the pre-rendered image (one of the animation frames) at the specified position in the window.
- **Sleep(milliseconds)**
  - Pauses the execution for the specified number of milliseconds, which controls the speed of the animation.

## 8. Summary

In summary, this code implements a heart-shaped particle animation using the EasyX graphics library in C:

- **Step 1**: It calculates original points on a heart curve using a mathematical formula.
- **Step 2**: It expands these points to generate numerous particles with random perturbations and scaling, creating a layered, diffused effect.
- **Step 3**: It pre-renders 20 frames of the animation by updating particle positions and drawing them to off-screen images.
- **Step 4**: In the main loop, it displays the frames in sequence with a residual fading effect, producing a smooth back-and-forth animation.
